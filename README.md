# Spring Crud Example

Spring Boot Crud Example-Vuejs-Mysql
 
For front-end:
	I search about front-end techs after i read this article https://tekkiwebsolutions.com/blog/comparison-of-angular-vs-react-vs-vue. 
	I decided Vue because my project is samll and vue learning curve is better React and Angular. Before I haven't coded vue , but always wondered. So this project my first vue project.
	Vue project folder name is task-vue-side. I added without node modules you need to npm install for modules.
	
	
For back-end:
	Easy choice for small project spring boot is best choice.I did not have difficulty using it because I actively use it in my business life.



For Db Side:
	Here I chose my-sql relational database that I did not use before because I was wondering because it was used a lot and I wanted to use it.
	I added CreateTableScript.sql for create table.
